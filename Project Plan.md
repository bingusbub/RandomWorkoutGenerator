# Resistance Training Workout Randomizer
=========================================
## What specific features will my program aim to achieve?
----------------------------------------------------------
+ Give the user the option to choose what body group to build a workout for:
Upper Body, Lower Body, Upper Push, Upper Pull, Full Body, Shoulders, Arms
+ Once the user chooses what body group, the program will randomly generate a workout with the following parameters:
> *4 to 8 exercises. Each exercise will have a fatigue number attached to it, so that the program will not generate a workout that is too fatiguing or exceeds a specific fatigue number* 
> *The program will select sets based on the fatigue number. (i.e. 1 set for very fatiguing exercises, 4 sets for less fatiguing exercises)*
> *repetition selection will be entirely random, and will sit between 8 reps and 30 reps*
> *The exercises will be listed from most fatiguing to least fatiguing*
> *each body group selection will have to meet a muscles used requirement (i.e. Although the program is randomly generated, the muscles worked will be comprehensive and hit atleast every muscle in that muscle group selection.)
